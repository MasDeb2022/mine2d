# A message from Bricky2023 from YT
Hey guys, it's me, BrickBreaker2023 from YT. This is my first project from CF2.5 I worked hard on.

Thank you. If you have Clickteam Fusion 2.5, you can compile it on your OS. But I'm pretty sure it only works on Windows.
Thank you again. I'm gonna leave an open-source code and a release.

Best regards,
Your friend Bricky from YT (https://youtube.com/@Bricky2023)
